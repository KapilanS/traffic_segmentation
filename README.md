# Traffic Segmentation

This repository focuses on traffic segmentation using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with ResNet50 and VGG16 models. The goal is to effectively detect and segment Indian road traffic into categories such as high, medium, and normal traffic. The models are trained on datasets specifically curated for Indian road scenarios.

## Models

The repository utilizes two popular CNN architectures for traffic segmentation:

1. **ResNet50**: A deep residual network known for its ability to train very deep neural networks.
2. **VGG16**: A classic architecture with a stack of convolutional layers, widely used in image classification tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is specifically tailored for Indian road scenarios. It includes images that are annotated and segmented to provide valuable training data for the CNN models. The goal is to categorize traffic into high, medium, and normal levels.

## Usage

To leverage the traffic segmentation models, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KapilanS/traffic_segmentation.git
